# 💳 Credit Appraisal Agent — AI That Learns from the Real World

> ⚡ *Open Source • Privacy-First • Self-Improving • Production-Ready*

---

## 🌍 Overview

The **Credit Appraisal Agent** is an open-source, explainable AI system that automates credit risk evaluation.
It analyzes income, collateral, and debt information to produce **transparent, bias-free, and legally compliant** lending decisions — instantly.

This Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is part of a broader **AI Agent Library** initiative: a collection of modular, self-improving agents designed to learn continuously from real users for real-world applications.

### 🤖 Hugging Face + Kaggle Sandbox

To accelerate experimentation with transformer backbones and public datasets,
the repository now ships with a **sandbox library** under
`services/api/agents/`:

| Agent Task | Hugging Face Checkpoint | Sample Kaggle Dataset | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Credit Appraisal | `roberta-base` | Give Me Some Credit | Creditworthiness classification |
| Asset Appraisal (text) | `distilbert-base-uncased` | House Prices – Advanced Regression | Property valuation heuristics |
| Asset Appraisal (image) | `google/vit-base-patch16-224` | House Prices – image features | Visual embeddings |
| KYC Agent (text) | `microsoft/layoutlm-base-uncased` | IDR Dataset | Document classification |
| KYC Agent (OCR) | `microsoft/trocr-base-stage1` | IDR Dataset | Text extraction |
| Fraud Detection | `bert-base-uncased` | Credit Card Fraud Detection | Anomaly scoring |
| Customer Support | `distilbert-base-uncased` | Bank Customer Complaints | Intent classification |

Each task is registered via `services/api/agents/model_registry.py`, providing
lazily loaded tokenizers/processors and models.  Fine-tuning orchestration lives
in `services/api/agents/trainer.py`, which can be executed directly:

```bash
python -m services.api.agents.trainer \
  --task_name credit_appraisal \
  --dataset_path datasets/give_me_some_credit.csv \
  --text_col description \
  --label_col target
```

The FastAPI training router exposes matching endpoints under `/v1/training/hf/*`
for UI and automation workflows.

## 🧬 The AI Agent Library Vision — Self-Improving by Design

The **Credit Appraisal Agent** is one node in a larger ecosystem of **AI micro-agents** (Credit, Fraud, KYC, AML, Real-Estate, Education, etc.).
Each agent continuously learns from real user feedback and retrains autonomously — forming a living, evolving **AI Factory** for practical business AI.

> 💡 *Each decision and user correction becomes a new training signal — a feedback loop that keeps improving the system organically.*

## 🌍 Compliance and Data Sovereignty

✅ 100 % compliant with **GDPR**, **Vietnam Data Law 2025**, and other global privacy regulations.
🔒 Trains only on **synthetic or anonymized data**, ensuring full legality on cross-border GPU infrastructure.
⚙️ Designed for **data localization**: only model weights, never personal data, are transmitted externally.

## 🧱 Deployment Flexibility

```bash
# Example: Deploy via Helm + Kustomize
helm upgrade --install credit-appraisal ./deployment \
  -f deployment/values.yaml -n credit-ai --create-namespace
