# 💳 Credit Appraisal Agent — AI That Learns from the Real World

> ⚡ *Open Source • Privacy-First • Self-Improving • Production-Ready*

---

## 🌍 Overview

The **Credit Appraisal Agent** is an open-source, explainable AI system that automates credit risk evaluation.
It analyzes income, collateral, and debt information to produce **transparent, bias-free, and legally compliant** lending decisions — instantly.

This Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is part of a broader **AI Agent Library** initiative: a collection of modular, self-improving agents designed to learn continuously from real users for real-world applications.

## 🤝 Future Integrations

### 🧠 Hugging Face & OpenLLM

Integrate transformer models to interpret unstructured documents (bank statements, payslips) for deeper scoring accuracy.

### 📊 Dataiku & Flowwise

Visual orchestration for automated retraining and multi-model decision pipelines (credit + fraud + risk).

### 📚 Open Datasets

Incorporate **UCI**, **Kaggle**, and **World Bank** datasets blended with anonymized local data to train models responsibly.

### 🌐 Multi-Cloud, Multi-Region

Deploy seamlessly across **Kubernetes**, **OpenStack**, or **GPU-for-Rent** sandboxes while respecting data-sovereignty laws.

## 🧬 The AI Agent Library Vision — Self-Improving by Design

The **Credit Appraisal Agent** is one node in a larger ecosystem of **AI micro-agents** (Credit, Fraud, KYC, AML, Real-Estate, Education, etc.).
Each agent continuously learns from real user feedback and retrains autonomously — forming a living, evolving **AI Factory** for practical business AI.

> 💡 *Each decision and user correction becomes a new training signal — a feedback loop that keeps improving the system organically.*

## 🌍 Compliance and Data Sovereignty

✅ 100 % compliant with **GDPR**, **Vietnam Data Law 2025**, and other global privacy regulations.
🔒 Trains only on **synthetic or anonymized data**, ensuring full legality on cross-border GPU infrastructure.
⚙️ Designed for **data localization**: only model weights, never personal data, are transmitted externally.

## 🧱 Deployment Flexibility

```bash
# Example: Deploy via Helm + Kustomize
helm upgrade --install credit-appraisal ./deployment \
  -f deployment/values.yaml -n credit-ai --create-namespace
```
