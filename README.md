# üí≥ Credit Appraisal Agent ‚Äî AI That Learns from the Real World

> ‚ö° *Open Source ‚Ä¢ Privacy-First ‚Ä¢ Self-Improving ‚Ä¢ Production-Ready*

## üåç Overview

The **Credit Appraisal Agent** is an open-source, explainable AI system that automates credit risk evaluation.
It analyzes income, collateral, and debt information to produce **transparent, bias-free, and legally compliant** lending decisions ‚Äî instantly.

This Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is part of a broader **AI Agent Library** initiative: a collection of modular, self-improving agents designed to learn continuously from real users for real-world applications.

## ü§ù Future Integrations

### üß† Hugging Face & OpenLLM

Integrate transformer models to interpret unstructured documents (bank statements, payslips) for deeper scoring accuracy.

### üìä Dataiku & Flowwise

Visual orchestration for automated retraining and multi-model decision pipelines (credit + fraud + risk).

### üìö Open Datasets

Incorporate **UCI**, **Kaggle**, and **World Bank** datasets blended with anonymized local data to train models responsibly.

## ü§ñ Hugging Face Sandbox Library (HF-kaggle branch)

The `HF-kaggle` branch ships a reusable sandbox library that pairs pre-trained Hugging Face checkpoints with Kaggle-ready fine-tuning utilities. Each agent includes a lightweight wrapper so you can bootstrap experiments without wiring up pipelines from scratch.

| Agent Type         | Task                                   | Default Hugging Face Model            | Example Kaggle Dataset                | Output Goal                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Credit Appraisal   | Credit scoring & risk classification   | `roberta-base`                        | Give Me Some Credit                   | Predict creditworthiness       |
| Asset Appraisal    | Property valuation (text + imagery)    | `distilbert-base-uncased` + `google/vit-base-patch16-224` | House Prices ‚Äì Advanced Regression | Estimate property valuation    |
| KYC Agent          | ID verification & OCR                  | `microsoft/layoutlm-base-uncased` + `microsoft/trocr-base-stage1` | IDR Dataset (OCR/Doc)              | Extract and classify identity  |
| Customer Support   | Chat intent classification             | `distilbert-base-uncased`             | Bank Customer Complaints              | Route intents / responses      |
| Fraud Detection    | Transaction anomaly detection (text)   | `bert-base-uncased`                   | Credit Card Fraud Detection           | Flag suspicious transactions   |

### Loading agents in Python

```python
from services.api.agents import CreditAppraisalTextAgent, AssetAppraisalAgent, KYCAgent

credit_agent = CreditAppraisalTextAgent()
scores = credit_agent.score_single("Applicant has stable income and low DTI")

asset_agent = AssetAppraisalAgent()
image_scores = asset_agent.score_images(["datasets/house_photo.jpg"])

kyc_agent = KYCAgent()
entities = kyc_agent.extract_entities("Name: Jane Doe\nPassport: X123456")
```

### Fine-tune with Kaggle datasets

Use the CLI entry point to fine-tune any registered task on a CSV/TSV dataset:

```bash
python -m services.api.agents.trainer \
  --task_name credit_appraisal \
  --dataset_path datasets/give_me_some_credit.csv \
  --text_col description \
  --label_col target \
  --num_train_epochs 3
```

The trainer persists weights and tokenizer artifacts under `~/credit-appraisal-agent-poc/models/<task>_trained/` along with a `training_meta.json` audit trail.

### REST endpoints for HF training

The FastAPI service exposes lightweight endpoints to orchestrate training runs remotely:

| Endpoint                | Description                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /v1/training/hf/tasks` | List registered Hugging Face tasks/models |
| `POST /v1/training/hf/train` | Trigger fine-tuning given dataset + columns |

`POST /v1/training/hf/train` accepts the same parameters as the CLI (`task_name`, `dataset_path`, `text_col`, `label_col`, etc.) and returns the output directory containing the newly trained checkpoint.

### üåê Multi-Cloud, Multi-Region

Deploy seamlessly across **Kubernetes**, **OpenStack**, or **GPU-for-Rent** sandboxes while respecting data-sovereignty laws.

## üß¨ The AI Agent Library Vision ‚Äî Self-Improving by Design

The **Credit Appraisal Agent** is one node in a larger ecosystem of **AI micro-agents** (Credit, Fraud, KYC, AML, Real-Estate, Education, etc.).
Each agent continuously learns from real user feedback and retrains autonomously ‚Äî forming a living, evolving **AI Factory** for practical business AI.

> üí° *Each decision and user correction becomes a new training signal ‚Äî a feedback loop that keeps improving the system organically.*

## üåç Compliance and Data Sovereignty

‚úÖ 100 % compliant with **GDPR**, **Vietnam Data Law 2025**, and other global privacy regulations.
üîí Trains only on **synthetic or anonymized data**, ensuring full legality on cross-border GPU infrastructure.
‚öôÔ∏è Designed for **data localization**: only model weights, never personal data, are transmitted externally.

## üß± Deployment Flexibility

```bash
# Example: Deploy via Helm + Kustomize
helm upgrade --install credit-appraisal ./deployment \
  -f deployment/values.yaml -n credit-ai --create-namespace
```
