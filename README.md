# 💳 Credit Appraisal Agent — AI That Learns from the Real World

> ⚡ *Open Source • Privacy-First • Self-Improving • Production-Ready*

---

## 🌍 Overview

The **Credit Appraisal Agent** is an open-source, explainable AI system that automates credit risk evaluation.
It analyzes income, collateral, and debt information to produce **transparent, bias-free, and legally compliant** lending decisions — instantly.

This Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is part of a broader **AI Agent Library** initiative: a collection of modular, self-improving agents designed to learn continuously from real users for real-world applications.

## 🤝 Future Integrations

### 🧠 Hugging Face & OpenLLM

Integrate transformer models to interpret unstructured documents (bank statements, payslips) for deeper scoring accuracy.

### 📊 Dataiku & Flowwise

Visual orchestration for automated retraining and multi-model decision pipelines (credit + fraud + risk).

### 📚 Open Datasets

Incorporate **UCI**, **Kaggle**, and **World Bank** datasets blended with anonymized local data to train models responsibly.

### 🌐 Multi-Cloud, Multi-Region

Deploy seamlessly across **Kubernetes**, **OpenStack**, or **GPU-for-Rent** sandboxes while respecting data-sovereignty laws.

## 🧬 The AI Agent Library Vision — Self-Improving by Design

The **Credit Appraisal Agent** is one node in a larger ecosystem of **AI micro-agents** (Credit, Fraud, KYC, AML, Real-Estate, Education, etc.).
Each agent continuously learns from real user feedback and retrains autonomously — forming a living, evolving **AI Factory** for practical business AI.

> 💡 *Each decision and user correction becomes a new training signal — a feedback loop that keeps improving the system organically.*

## 🌍 Compliance and Data Sovereignty

✅ 100 % compliant with **GDPR**, **Vietnam Data Law 2025**, and other global privacy regulations.
🔒 Trains only on **synthetic or anonymized data**, ensuring full legality on cross-border GPU infrastructure.
⚙️ Designed for **data localization**: only model weights, never personal data, are transmitted externally.

## 🧱 Deployment Flexibility

```bash
# Example: Deploy via Helm + Kustomize
helm upgrade --install credit-appraisal ./deployment \
  -f deployment/values.yaml -n credit-ai --create-namespace
```

Accessible via:

```

## 🧰 Global AI Sandbox Integration

The credit appraisal agent now ships with tooling to participate in the global
[AI-AIGENTbythePeoplesANDBOX](https://github.com/Sherlock2019/AI-AIGENTbythePeoplesANDBOX.git)
infrastructure where **each agent lives in its own repository**.

1. **Bootstrap the multi-repo workspace**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/init_multi_repo.sh
   ./scripts/init_multi_repo.sh --workspace ~/rackspace-aisandbox \
       --hub-ref main --credit-ref main --asset-ref main
   ```
   The script clones the official
   [`AI-AIGENTbythePeoplesANDBOX`](https://github.com/Sherlock2019/AI-AIGENTbythePeoplesANDBOX.git)
   repository, adds the credit and asset appraisal services as git submodules,
   and (optionally) seeds FastAPI boilerplate when the orchestrator repo is
   empty. Use `--skip-seed` if the hub already contains its own implementation,
   or run `./scripts/init_multi_repo.sh --help` for additional options (e.g.
   pinning specific branches).

2. **Configure agent discovery**
   - Copy `infra/agent_registry.example.yaml` to `infra/agent_registry.yaml`.
   - Update the URLs to match where each agent is running (local ports, Docker
     containers, or remote servers).

3. **Launch the stack**
   - Start each agent (credit, asset, etc.).
   - Run the hub FastAPI app inside the orchestrator repo: `uvicorn
     services.api.main:app --port 8090`.
   - Invoke the hub endpoint: `curl -X POST
     http://localhost:8090/run/credit_appraisal -d '{"text": "sample"}'`.

See `docs/multi_repo_sandbox.md` for a deeper walkthrough that covers the
repository layout, CI/CD considerations, and ideas for extending the shared
agent ecosystem.
